  unsupervised learning and in deep architectures for transfer learning and
    other tasks. In spite of their fundamental role, only linear autoencoders
    over the real numbers have been solved analytically. Here we present
    a general mathematical framework for the study of both linear and non-linear
    autoencoders. The framework allows one to derive an analytical treatment for
    the most non-linear autoencoder, the Boolean autoencoder. Learning in the
    Boolean autoencoder is equivalent to a clustering problem that can be solved
    in polynomial time when the number of clusters is small and becomes NP
    complete when the number of clusters is large. The framework sheds light on
    the different kinds of autoencoders, their learning complexity, their
    horizontal and vertical composability in deep architectures, their critical
    points, and their fundamental connections to clustering, Hebbian learning,
  and information theory.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2011 International

The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated.

ABSTRACT = {This work proposes a new computational framework for learning a structured generative model for real-world datasets. In particular, we propose to learn a Closed-loop Transcriptionbetween a multi-class, multi-dimensional data distribution and a Linear discriminative representation (CTRL) in the feature space that consists of multiple independent multi-dimensional linear subspaces. In particular, we argue that the optimal encoding and decoding mappings sought can be formulated as a two-player minimax game between the encoder and decoderfor the learned representation. A natural utility function for this game is the so-called rate reduction, a simple information-theoretic measure for distances between mixtures of subspace-like Gaussians in the feature space. Our formulation draws inspiration from closed-loop error feedback from control systems and avoids expensive evaluating and minimizing of approximated distances between arbitrary distributions in either the data space or the feature space. To a large extent, this new formulation unifies the concepts and benefits of Auto-Encoding and GAN and naturally extends them to the settings of learning a both discriminative and generative representation for multi-class and multi-dimensional real-world data. Our extensive experiments on many benchmark imagery datasets demonstrate tremendous potential of this new closed-loop formulation: under fair comparison, visual quality of the learned decoder and classification performance of the encoder is competitive and arguably better than existing methods based on GAN, VAE, or a combination of both. Unlike existing generative models, the so-learned features of the multiple classes are structured instead of hidden: different classes are explicitly mapped onto corresponding independent principal subspaces in the feature space, and diverse visual attributes within each class are modeled by the independent principal components within each subspace.},

abstract = {In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models defy this and instead select different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model--with an outrageous number of parameters--but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs, and training instability. We address these with the introduction of the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques mitigate the instabilities, and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large (Raffel et al., 2019) to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the "Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus", and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.},

It then uses a set of generative weights to convert the code vector into an approximate reconstruction of the input vector. We derive an objective function for training autoencoders based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The aim is to minimize the information required to describe both the code vector and the reconstruction error. We show that this information is minimized by choosing code vectors stochastically according to a Boltzmann distribution, where the generative weights define the energy of each possible code vector given the input vector. Unfortunately, if the code vectors use distributed representations, it is exponentially expensive to compute this Boltzmann distribution because it involves all possible code vectors. We show that the recognition weights of an autoencoder can be used to compute an approximation to the Boltzmann distribution and that this approximation gives an upper bound on the description length. Even when this bound is poor, it can be used as a Lyapunov function for learning both the generative and the recognition weights. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to learn factorial codes.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems}, pages = {3–10}, numpages = {8}, location = {Denver, Colorado}, series = {NIPS'93} }

abstract = {We consider the problem of learning discriminative representations for data in a high-dimensional space with distribution supported on or around multiple low-dimensional linear subspaces. That is, we wish to compute a linear injective map of the data such that the features lie on multiple orthogonal subspaces. Instead of solving this learning problem using multiple instances of principal component analysis (PCA), we cast it as a sequential game using the closed-loop transcription (CTRL) framework recently proposed for learning discriminative and generative representations for general low-dimensional submanifolds. We prove that the equilibrium solutions to the game indeed give the correct representations. Our approach unifies classical methods of learning subspaces with modern machine learning practice, by showing that subspace learning problems may be provably solved using the modern toolkit of representation learning. In addition, our work provides the first theoretical justification for the CTRL framework in the important special case of linear subspaces. We support our theoretical findings with compelling empirical evidence. We also generalize the sequential game formulation to more general representation learning problems. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.}

  abstract = 	 {A central problem in machine learning involves modeling complex data-sets using highly flexible families of probability distributions in which learning, sampling, inference, and evaluation are still analytically or computationally tractable. Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.}

abstract = {The significantly expanded and updated new edition of a widely used text on reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics. Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.}

  abstract = 	 {This paper proposes an unsupervised method for learning a unified representation that serves both discriminative and generative purposes. While most existing unsupervised learning approaches focus on a representation for only one of these two goals, we show that a unified representation can enjoy the mutual benefits of having both. Such a representation is attainable by generalizing the recently proposed closed-loop transcription framework, known as CTRL, to the unsupervised setting. This entails solving a constrained maximin game over a rate reduction objective that expands features of all samples while compressing features of augmentations of each sample. Through this process, we see discriminative low-dimensional structures emerge in the resulting representations.  Under comparable experimental conditions and network complexities, we demonstrate that these structured representations enable classification performance close to state-of-the-art unsupervised discriminative representations, and conditionally generated image quality significantly higher than that of state-of-the-art unsupervised generative models.}

abstract="In this paper, we show how to harness both low-rank and sparse structures in regular or near regular textures for image completion. Our method leverages the new convex optimization for low-rank and sparse signal recovery and can automatically correctly repair the global structure of a corrupted texture, even without precise information about the regions to be completed. Through extensive simulations, we show our method can complete and repair textures corrupted by errors with both random and contiguous supports better than existing low-rank matrix recovery methods. Through experimental comparisons with existing image completion systems (such as Photoshop) our method demonstrate significant advantage over local patch based texture synthesis techniques in dealing with large corruption, non-uniform texture, and large perspective deformation.",

We start by studying the statistics of natural images including the scale invariant properties, then generic prior models were learned to duplicate the observed statistics, based on the minimax entropy theory studied in two previous papers. The resulting Gibbs distributions have potentials of the form $Uleft( {{schmi{bf I}};,Lambda ,,S} right)=sumnolimits_{alpha =1}^K {sumnolimits_{ left( {x,y} right)} {lambda ^{left( alpha right)}}}left( {left( {F^{left( alpha right)}*{schmi{bf I}}} right)left( {x,y} right)} right)$ with S = {F(1), F(2), ..., F(K)} being a set of filters and = { (1)(), (2)(), ..., (K)()} the potential functions. The learned Gibbs distributions confirm and improve the form of existing prior models such as line-process, but, in contrast to all previous models, inverted potentials (i.e., (x) decreasing as a function of |x|) were found to be necessary. We find that the partial differential equations given by gradient descent on U(I; , S) are essentially reaction-diffusion equations, where the usual energy terms produce anisotropic diffusion, while the inverted energy terms produce reaction associated with pattern formation, enhancing preferred image features. We illustrate how these models can be used for texture pattern rendering, denoising, image enhancement, and clutter removal by careful choice of both prior and data models of this type, incorporating the appropriate features.}, journal = {IEEE Trans.

abstract = "After a decade of extensive study of the sparse representation synthesis model, we can safely say that this is a mature and stable field, with clear theoretical foundations, and appealing applications. Alongside this approach, there is an analysis counterpart model, which, despite its similarity to the synthesis alternative, is markedly different. Surprisingly, the analysis model did not get a similar attention, and its understanding today is shallow and partial. In this paper we take a closer look at the analysis approach, better define it as a generative model for signals, and contrast it with the synthesis one. This work proposes effective pursuit methods that aim to solve inverse problems regularized with the analysis-model prior, accompanied by a preliminary theoretical study of their performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the analysis model in several experiments, and provide a detailed study of the model associated with the 2D finite difference analysis operator, a close cousin of the TV norm."

In practice, we show that a single model learns photographic noise removal, denoising synthetic Monte Carlo images, and reconstruction of undersampled MRI scans - all corrupted by different processes - based on noisy data only.}
